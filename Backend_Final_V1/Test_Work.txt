Hi Vijay,

Please find the topics to learn about and project to build before you join the internship. A good starting point is searching simple tutorials on Google and YouTube, and starting to browse through their official project and documentation pages.

Topics:
- FAST API
- SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL
- InfluxDB

Project:
Problem Statement : Build a REST API in FAST API that has 2 endpoints. 
(Use PostgreSQL or InfluxDB as a Backend Database)

Endpoint 1: Can receive continuous data in the following format:
freshWaterLevel: float
batteryLevel       : float
robotLinearVelocity: float
robotAngularVelocity: float
areaName: str
When it receives this data, it stores it in the database in the same structure along with a timestamp of when the data was received.

Endpoint 2: We can use this endpoint to fetch data from the same Database between any two timestamps (say 11th Jan 2022 11.54 AM to 14th Feb 2022 11.33 PM)

Please let me know if you have any questions or queries. Feel free to reach out any time anywhere if you get stuck at any point or need any guidance.
