Project:
Problem Statement : Build a REST API in FAST API that has 2 endpoints. 
(Use PostgreSQL or InfluxDB as a Backend Database)

Endpoint 1: Can receive continuous data in the following format:
freshWaterLevel: float
batteryLevel       : float
robotLinearVelocity: float
robotAngularVelocity: float
areaName: str
When it receives this data, it stores it in the database in the same structure along with a timestamp of when the data was received.

Endpoint 2: We can use this endpoint to fetch data from the same Database between any two timestamps (say 11th Jan 2022 11.54 AM to 14th Feb 2022 11.33 PM)
